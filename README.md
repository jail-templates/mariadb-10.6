# MariaDB Server 10.6
Bastille template to install and configure MariaDB Server with some sane defaults.

* Disables remote access to MySQL and databases.
* Removes default anonymous users and test databases.
* Has user configurable MySQL settings in /usr/local/etc/mysql/custom.cnf.

## Bootstrap
```
bastille bootstrap https://github.com/jail-templates/mariadb-10.6
```

## Apply template
```
bastille template $JAIL jail-templates/mariadb-10.6
```

## Connecting to databases
Do note that by default there is no localhost inside non-VNET jails. When creating a MySQL user that can only be accessed from the localhost (e.g. `CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'localhost'`), use the $JAIL IP address instead (i.e. `CREATE USER 'wordpress'@'1.2.3.4'`).
